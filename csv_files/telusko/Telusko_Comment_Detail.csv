89,praveen s,It may or may not be worth learning everything in the span of 4 or 6 months. It's too much and can't be digestive. It took me around 2 years to become a full stack developer while working in a company. I would recommend learn either UI or backend and later the other one. Thanks

406,Luke Lincoln,"< first got into BTC back in 2016 and have been hodling/buying sats at different price points since.  I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy the dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.  I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 11` btc with 3.1btc in just 5weeks from day trading with Expert MR. Barton L William Crypto in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish. Technical analysis is my second You can reach MR William on Õ≤eI—î…†…æŒ±m @ Bartonsignal.  Cheers thank me later."

517,Fabian Madueke,"PHP is miles ahead on this abstractions, you will loose a little time during compilation due to having to detect the types, but it simplifies programming, but with more powerful servers being developed with multiple cores, you hardly notice the difference, but also java still have an advantage because codes are using compiled before running, instead of compilation on the fly as seem on the interpreter based languages, like PHP & Python.
