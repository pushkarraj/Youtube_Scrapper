124,Shubham Upadhyay,Hello Hitesh Mai Aapka ek Interview dekha tha jisme aapne incubator Ke Bare mein batya tha Mai ek innovation startup suru karane ja raha hu jisme aapka support chahiye. PLZ Reply @Hitesh Chaudhary
125,ANAND KUMAR GUPTA,"Hello Hitesh,

I just wanted to know one thing: The ""Devops "" course comes with job assistance but with a condition that I have to also do an internship with Ineuron.

My problem is that I am working for an MNC as a full-time employee, so how can I do an internship simultaneously?

If I am not doing an internship from Ineuron, then I will also be given job assistance or not.

Happy Teachers' day to you!"
126,Demon Legit,"I want to thank you , you saved me from going into ISA with your vid on that, I have a 2 year gap between my education for financial reasons, and was scared I won't get offers on campus, I didn't, but I got good at programming in 6 months, going from discrete maths all the way to comp coding. Confident I can crack any job I'm in my 7th sem, no on campus offers but offcampus 17 lpa, all self study , free moocs some tough books and selfless mentors like you."
127,Exam Solu,Kindly include this course in tech neuron package..
128,Manpreet Dhaliwal,"Already have few of your courses in progress RN, can't afford time for another one but devOps is something in demand and it is really hard to find good devOps engineer  it took our company almost month to find 2 good engineers. so if someone have both time and money I will surely suggest them to take this course."
129,Biswajit Pradhan,"Hi sir,
Thank you for bringing this course for us.
I have one question after completion of this course can we get our hands on real time projects.so that after completion it we can easy sat on interview"
130,Sudhanshu Tripathi,Sir the way you explain and way of communication is great
131,Dhairya Patel,Great course sir. I have one question that this live lessons will be recorded right? Means if I miss 1 lecture then I can see the recordings?
132,Aryan Kumar,"i wish there were pre-recorded videos which i could watch and finish up in a month or two, with doubt clearing forums...... as a person looking to learn skills not to get a job but advance their free lancing skills  this is a bit too long sir 6-8 months"
133,Gaurav Maurya,"Hi Hitesh, I am working in an azure based cloud environment. Will it not pose problems for me as all the learnings are based on aws  in your course ?"
134,Lokesh,Much awaited course sir
135,Anirudh,Top notch quality delivered! 
136,Techno Spark,I remember you told that you will provide courses with nominal fee. I could see that fees are getting increased day by day. I do respect your effort but 12-13k is much for person who is not earning. I have a more respect for khan Sir who has created courses for just 130 Rs. and he is proving it. I have seen that people first start with free youtube videos and slowly open a company then start charging high. That is what happening now a days.
137,Raju Singh,Hi Hitesh thanks for making this video I just wanted to know more like course Fee classes timings n all??
138,Maheen Kabeer,Continue the js course. Be consistent

146,Shubham Lipane,"Please add this course in tech neuron, at least its recodings"
147,Exam Solu,Will we get labs for testing and practice??
148,Alok Kumar Mallik,"Hi Hitesh,
This looks great.However have couple of questions..

1.Does it cover build tools like Maven,graddle  etc
2.Does it cover Artifacts management like Nexus
3.It covers AWS services for Devops or regular devops as well cause some companies still use the regular form of devops without cloud"
149,Partha Sarathi Mondal,"Hi hitesh, will it be included in tech neuron package ?"
150,WASIF ALI MA K BHUSRA PXTANI,"Skills needed 1 cloudops 2022 not devops 2 whatever projects migration + security + mix match clouds ( streaming aws and paas azure and k8 gcp)

Please remove public voting feature and instead only let group of experts to vote on the projects. The expert could be invitational only such that findcoder should invite experts for the domain to vote and show their consensus much like how awwwards chooses the best designed website.
 
Public voting could be replaced with likes and also let the user to sort the list based on likes while only expert votes should decide the best projects."

U can add a feature where pro coders(like u, people u hire or other contributers) can remotely debug codes for the users or code for them live in their machines (i think there's similar feature in vs code) 
But for sure u have to look for security risks for that as well.
U can give monetary benefits or ranking to motivate contributers.
Hope this community gets huge recognition internationally. ️"

The value passed as the parameter of Boolean object is converted to a boolean value. If the value is empty or is 0, -0, null, false, NaN, undefined, or the empty string (""""), than the object has an initial value of false. 
Now All other values, including any object, an empty array ([]), or the string ""false"", create an object with an initial value of true. That's why Boolean([]) is True. 

Reference: MDN."

1338,Coding Cush,I love the way you teach sir ️
1339,Rajnish Jha,JS is compiled or an interpreted PL: My take on this is since JS has evolved quite a bit over the last few years so we can say that JS is both compiled and interpreted PL as we are using NODE JS which provides JS Runtime Environment in order to execute the JS source code.
1340,Rajesh Kumar,Deep knowledge thank you for this
1341,Mohammad Maqsood,thank you for doing much help for JS community

1353,priyansh vatsal,Very useful 
1354,Sri Harsha Chilakapati,"Honestly, this interpreted or compiled question is out of the way for me, and I've stopped asking it in interviews since last two years. What's weird is this gets even more confusing for languages that output to multiple targets. Take Kotlin for example, it has 3 targets:

Kotlin/JVM - compiles to JVM bytecode, and HotSpot uses JIT, so it isn't machine code yet
Kotlin/JS - generates JS source code, just translation
Kotlin/Native - directly compiles to object code (llvm) and linker (ld) generates a native binary

Of course, all this is not relevant at all. When one hires a JavaScript developer, one should look for candidate's level of understanding, and whether the candidate can work on your codebase or not. So, if you are asking this question in interviews today, I'd love to know what are you looking from the candidate? To me, this question today doesn't get much."

1364,Rajnish Jha,"I am getting confused about reserved keywords in JS: As per my understanding in JS world,  A word that changes its color or better to say which glitters more colorful (blue, orange etc.) in the code editor are called reserved keywords. Please correct me if I am over-thinking!"
1365,akshay hulkuli,The vs code theme that your are using is really awesome. Please the theme name.....
1366,Adi Pradhan,Boi o boi... Amazing quality ️
1367,1DS19EC044-Gorang jain,"Summary:
In this lecture we have studied about some basics of JavaScript which includes-
•For declaring variable we should always use let instead of var.
•const we use which means that the value of that variable doesn't get changed even if we assign the new value for that variable.
•Unicode -Are the special characters which looks same but have different internal unicode for that ,we define it with /u , for example ù it looks like u but it isn't.
•We use semicolon in a defensive manner.
•Javascript is basically made for interpreter langauge.
•We should never use reserved keywords as variable.
•Some of the reserved variables which in not yet declared reserved are enum.
