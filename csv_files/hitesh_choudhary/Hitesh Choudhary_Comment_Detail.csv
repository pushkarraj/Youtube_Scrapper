I can be wrong too. I just felt that so I said it."
1,Meet Bhalodiya,Ahha it is great. Things sounds easy because I have already started to learning a little form here n there and I will for sure get perfect understanding by watching your series. I have also started using TS with react projects but it ain't easy as it seems for now 
2,Devraj Jangid,"Love you sir 
You have helped me a lot in learning programming."
3,Prathamesh Dukare,Super Exited to learn TS from you Hitesh!
4,Kunal Singh,Thanks for the video much needed.
5,Venkatesh Lingampally,You are rocking 
6,Anurag Band,Is this series includes React Typescript???
7,sagar,Great video
8,Sujeet Kumar,"Hello sir, big fan."
9,Praxss,looks like you forgot to silent your phone
10,Mustafa Kapadia,"I saw a bit of the code generated by the builder when you were on that page, what I saw was it is aligning stuff with position absolute. I think such tools are awesome for prototyping (even though I don't see the point to do this since Figma already has a strong prototyping system built in) but I am not sure that it can be used in production."
11,Tech_Wizard,Please make a detailed video on scope of native applications over cross platform apps in the future.... It's a question of many people
12,Rahul Ahire,The idea is really great. I'd love to see someone coming up the same for threejs for interactivity. Import blender model and just auto-animate the glTF data.
13,Make Authority Hindi,"Yes, I use the locofy. It's good but needs the increase speed of conversion."
14,Techi Mac Amit,"I am participating in this challenge. Going to use figma for the first time. But yeah, will be happy to learn and “we write code”. Going to share screenshot."
15,Salyn Tarn,"The amount of time you spent to changing code, stuff, add stuff, remove stuff from this builder = amount of time you get the design file and code it with coffee."
16,Kawaljeet singh Rathore,"Hi Hitesh,  I'm participating in the challenge and I'm going to build my portfolio using this tool."
17,leela krishna,Awesome makes devp faster. Such an ease of usage n development.
18,Meet Bhalodiya,it feels like learning web designing now 
19,Subhash,"1) Go to figma community section
2) Copy to your figma dashboard
3) Open copied file and you are good to go."
20,yash rajan shukla,That's so awesome  thanks for sharing it with us
21,Yash Solanki,I'm bullish on this tool. Thanks hitesh for introducing us to a MasterPiece!
22,Mukesh Bagaria,Hello Hitesh sir I'm participating in this challenge  and excited to see  if this tool can convert my design into react code or not... Will post my result on LinkedIn comments..
23,Vimal Rijal,"Now its a video with some effects, its really cool "
24,Prabhjot Singh,"Participating in contest 

And I think this plugin is good. It even has an option for Gatsby, I want see to how this will work on more dynamic projects"
25,Kuntal Paul,"Not participating in the challenge.

I tried it, but there was a major alignment issue after building the design. Also, the current stage of locofy seems good for a 1-page website with a simple block design, absolutely not recommended for a proper multipage web app at least for now. Locofy won't be able to build from a full-scale professional design file.

Disclaimer: The above review is solely based on my limited ability to operate the app for a professional project, would love to know a better way of handling the problems I faced."
26,Coder's Gyan,"Getting swag is great  I have one question though, when are you going  to contact to find coder io challenge winners? ( Link previewer challenge ) and send their T shirts ? 

Btw, this tool is really great. I will be giving a try. Thank you for this informative video."
