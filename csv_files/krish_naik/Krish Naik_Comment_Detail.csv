1. Validating distribution of target variable 
2. Before building models we do have a few hypothesis in our mind or business. After getting the data and target finalization we have to test our hypothesis using various tests.
3. Hypothesis testing used in feature selection as well. Like if a variable adding significant value to a model predictions
4. After models building statistics used in modeling monitoring such as significant reduction in model performance accuracy or KS or hit rate etc"

3,venki vtz,"To find how your model perform, most of the times we use different measurements like f1-score etc... are also statistical measurements only. A small question to all, why we have to divide with n-1 for Variance or SD for sample , but when we calculate for population Var or SD, we divide with n ( n is the no of subjects in the sample or sample size) . Dont escape with avoid Bias. let us make it more statistical"
