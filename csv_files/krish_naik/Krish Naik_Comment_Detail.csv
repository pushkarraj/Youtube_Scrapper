0,Anurag,"Few use cases of statistics in predictive modeling:
1. Validating distribution of target variable 
2. Before building models we do have a few hypothesis in our mind or business. After getting the data and target finalization we have to test our hypothesis using various tests.
3. Hypothesis testing used in feature selection as well. Like if a variable adding significant value to a model predictions
4. After models building statistics used in modeling monitoring such as significant reduction in model performance accuracy or KS or hit rate etc"

2,venki vtz,"To find how your model perform, most of the times we use different measurements like f1-score etc... are also statistical measurements only. A small question to all, why we have to divide with n-1 for Variance or SD for sample , but when we calculate for population Var or SD, we divide with n ( n is the no of subjects in the sample or sample size) . Dont escape with avoid Bias. let us make it more statistical"

Here max profit is 17"
17,Akshay Kumar Singh,"In first question- 
For finding min price why we are using loop, we can just do list.min() take the value and store in a variable. And then with that reference find max benefit, that's it. 

No? 
Am I wrong, please correct me anyone."

20,RAGHU RAM,"Hi Sir.. my request, please make industry specific projects like 5 projects all from banking domain,5 projects from retail,5 projects from Healthcare etc.. that will help candidates from functional background  who are speacialised in single domain.. generalist can opt for this existing course & specialist can choose their domain.."
21,Bibek Rauth,"It's great. But the only concern is when you say the industry-ready project, it's not the same.  Because free data doesn't represent the actual raw data. Many times when we work on a project it takes months to understand and gather the data. And working on 5 or 6 different domain projects, would not give a business understanding of any of the domains. Rather working on a particular domain's 5 6 projects would build the understanding."
22,Tanish,"Nice one, this is what i was looking for and got it. but few suggestions from thecomments box like DL, NLP nd domain wise projrct can be looked into if possible...thank you so much sir. you are doing an amazing socialwork (vidhya seva, which greater thanall) by your DS videos and guidelines. thank you again and wish you all success in your life."

Just a suggestion like the career or skill track for the domain like datacamp or 365 data science.

177,venkat anil Adibhatla,"Hey Krish I think something is wrong with your screen,I can see only half of your screen.i am not sure ,if everyone has this issue.please confirm it."
178,Abhishek Chatterjee,"In case of Kmeans it uses distance from centroid as a measure of similarity and due to this metrics it can compute distance of a unknown data point to the closest centroid and assign a label to it.

For hierarchical clustering algos, the problem statement is to figure out all possible sets of cluster which it does in a interative manner either starting from top / bottom and dividing / fusing data points using affinity and linkage method. So for a new data point it can not predict which cluster as it does not have a measure to do so other than recomputing entire clustering which is again the fit method.

Same goes for spatial ones as they measure similarity / disimilarity using density estimation so it can not predict a label for a single data point hence no predict method."
179,Souvik Adhikary,"In my opinion The way of computing clusters makes all the difference:
1. Firstly in K-means, a data-point is assigned to the cluster with the closest centroid and then the centroids are updated afterwards. So, predicting in the K-means is actually assigning the datapoints without updating the clusters, given that the prediction data are from the same distribution of data as the training set.
2. DBSCAN on the other hand finds the cluster based on the high-density areas of the dataset. These densities are parametrized by parameters epsilon and min-points. This is done by computing point properties i.e whether the point is a core, border and noise or outlier. Now during predicting if the new points are close to, say a noise and core point, the point could mess up the previous clustering results and make the noise point a border or within epsilon. This could also be the case with (min-points-1) new points added within the epsilon of noise, which again will recompute the cluster.
3. Same as DBSCAN, Agglomerative (bottom-up approach) clustering iteratively builds the cluster starting from single data points and successively agglomerates pairs of cluster until all the clusters are merged into a single cluster according to a linkage measure. Let the linkage measure be ""single"", which merges the clusters if all the points between two cluster are less than a threshold. Now adding a new point during prediction could trigger a merge between two clusters that would have been separated otherwise. Thus predicting here also requires recomputing."
180,Zevier Sunil Seema,"I think it is because When you use k-means clustering you define the k i.e. the number of centroids i.e. also the number of clusters you want your k-means model to divide your dataset into. 
So the number of clusters the k-means model divides the X_train dataset into is equal to the number of clusters the k-means model divides the X_test dataset into as the number of clusters/centroids (k) is given by us to the model.
This is the reason why we are able to predict when using k-means clustering.
Now when it comes to dbscan or agglomerative clustering
It is the model/algorithm that gives us the numbers of clusters it has 
divided our dataset into.
So the number of clusters the model divides the X_train dataset into may or may not be equal to the number of clusters the model divides the X_test 
dataset into as both of these dataset i.e. X_train and X_test are two different datasets.
And this is the reason why we are not able to predict when using dbscan and agglomerative clustering.
So to conclude, the reason that we are able to predict in k-means clustering is that the number of clusters formed in the train dataset is equal to the number of clusters formed in the test dataset when used k-means clustering 
And the reason we are not able to predict in dbscan and agglomerative clustering is that the number of clusters formed in the train dataset may or may not be equal to the number of clusters formed in the test dataset when used dbscan or agglomerative clustering."
181,Ayush Anchal,"In k-means, new data point is assigned to the closest centroid 
But in hierarchical clustering, it builds clusters iteratively starting from single data point,  if a new data point comes it will recompute the clusters an hence can entirely modify the final cluster."
182,Ayan Chowdhury,"In my opinion, 
Kmeans clustering uses number of clusters on the k value. It is just formation of non overlapping clusters which are similar to one another. Hence test data can be predicted. 
But for agronomic clustering, it divides the data into bottom up or top down way. That is single cluster is created and natural hierarchy is formed as set of tree. On predicting test data the labels on which the tree or hierarchy can be formed in unknown. 
Similar thing goes in DBScan clustering, it creates clusters on the theme of reachability and connectivity which is a density function. Here epsilon is very important in finding the clusters. If we take the same labels for predicting test data it may include all noises and would be highly ineffective."
183,"𝑹, 𝒋","Sir, which will be better to me in terms of Salary and opportunities? Software developer v/s Data Scientist?
I am third year Engineering student from tier-3 college..."
184,Nadmaan Fazeel,"DBSCAN doesn't initialize centers because there is no centers in DBSCAN ( it works on connectivity of points). 
Kmeans family perform classification( like KNN algorithm) using the previous cluster center and then update the centers. 

Solution to this problem :- 
In R, there is a predict function under DBSCAN class , first it will cluster the data then we have the dataset of data points vs label , here it becomes a classification problem when new points come we will assign a label based on our classification model. 

Drawbacks of kmeans 
1. Can't deal with periodic data ( angle, hours etc) 
2.prone to outlier 
3. Require prior cluster information 
4. Performed badly on high dimensional data 
5. Clusters are always in spherical form and not of arbitrary shape."
185,Killer Gaming,Sir can you please tell a method in which data is provided in text files one by one like all the features have their name in rows and only one value for each feature is present in text file and 1000 of text files like this are there so how to merge all the text files in one csv file with features as columns
186,Harsh Maheshwari,for agglomerative it must be recomputational approach as top to down  which consume lots of work for algorithm.........
187,Harsh Maheshwari,in case of dbscan....it do it with density approach and single data point cannot be the estimator of density ...that's why prediction is not the case

For me now maths is almost boring and i study vedic maths and implementation of this in Physics and Computers...so yeah maths made me inclined towards pursuing this data science...

299,Anil Bhargava,"2 scenarios: 

1) If there are only 2 Pin code data available and the rest are missing. Then replace the Pin code column with A Pin code dummy variable with missing as 1 and non-missing as 0.

2) If we know that multiple Pin codes are missing, if a substantial number like 90% of the Pin codes are missing, drop that column. If less, say 27% of Pin discreet categorically column and apply one hot encoding with multiple levels, wherein, look at the frequency distribution of the pin code and take a call. If the distribution is random, then push the business to provide data for these, if no data is available for this then ask the business whether this column is very important if not remove the column."
300,Agnik Chowdhury,Looking forward to learning all of these soon from you Krish..super excited to see you in class..

314,The Algorithm,Big fan sir
315,spicytuna08,cannot drop customer id if you need to make some recommendation per customer
316,shahbaz ansari,for pincode encoding I think min-max scaling technique is a better option because using this range will be between 0 to 1.
317,Rahul Sharma,Happy Birthday sir
318,Abhishek Kulkarni,Pincode encoding = p(class|pincode)/len(pincode column)
319,Rahul Tekade,We have city feature as  tier i ii III then why do we need pincode?
320,Zaafir C,"Features to be dropped
 
CustomerID - It is just an id column
 
Pin Code - Too many data is missing
 
We can use a variance threshold to remove low variance features as well
 
City Tier has low variance
 
 
Missing values
 
For numerical features such as age, we can use univariate imputation techniques such as mean/median or we could use random imputation as well.
 
If distribution of age is normal, I would use mean
If distribution of age is skewed, I would use median
 
But if there are many missing values in the age column, mean/median would change the shape of the distribution of the age column
 
we could then use random imputation.
 
 
These are univariate techniques
But we could also use multivariate techniques such as knn imputation or mice.
 
For categorical features, we can use most frequent/mode or we can use random imputation
 
We can also use knn imputation or mice.
 
 
For pin code encoding, we can use target encoding
(but as we are already missing lots of values, I don’t think it would be necessary)
 
Derived features - This one would require domain knowledge
 
I was thinking of converting the age into a categorical feature using numerical encoding techniques like discretization/binning.
Creating categories like
30-40(Young),40-50(Mid),50+(Old)
 
 
But if we do not have domain knowledge, we could be using pca techniques to transform the high dimensional data into low dimensional and at the same time keeping the essence of the data.
 
 
 
In terms of feature scaling, it all depends what model we are using. 
If we are using models that require the dependent variables to be normally distributed, then we can apply log transformation,box-cox transformation to convert into normal distribution"
321,MOHAMMED AZHARUDDIN,"I just needed this, i was demotivated that other are transitioning and i am not doing this fast enough. Thank you krish."
322,Adejumo Ridwan,"6 key points to remember 
2:10 Don't be hard on yourself 
3:26 Give yourself time 
4:00 Don't worry about the outcome 
4:43 Keep on learning and Preparing continuously. 
5:50 Don't Feel demotivated 
6:44 Take help from Google."
323,AHAM GUPTA,"Just one suggestion
When we say or read sentences where negation is used like ""Don't worry much"", our mind omits the negation and our focus is completely on that #worry part whereas when we reframe this particular sentence as ""Just chill and be positive regarding your hard work"", we are more inclined towards the positive side :) 
Btw, thank you so much for teaching us, sir :)"

869,ThinkIt,️️
870,Tanuj Kumar,priya bhatia's DSA playlist was too good ..so deep explanation  #onenueron
871,Raa m,With python
872,Samuel Ogunlola,"For the use case 1 (recommendation system). 

First we would need a lot of demographic information about the customers (already existing) . Do a deep dive analysis on triggers or the type of insurance they fall into. A groupby would be a nice way to check,

Secondly, just the same way an RFM analysis is done in the financial sector, check the recency, frequency and product/insurance groups you have created in the first steps. Try binning them ranking from 1 to 5 or n (depending on the distribution of the data. ) 

(Do a little visualization to see if the behavioral partner is captured. )
Thirdly, running a simple unsupervised clustering either (k-means  or GMM initialized with k-means ) taking all precursor using the previous classification with their demographic information as parameters . 

Now the recommendation system would be making recommendations to people who fall in the same final cluster. 

I think this should solve the first use case. For model evaluation use the accuracy, but try reducing the false positives as that is much more dangerous business wise than false negatives."
873,vaishu priya,For 1st use case..we can first do clustering and segment customers into different groups and then we could apply multi-class classification based on previous data on each segment and built recommendation system based on classification results
874,Sruthi Rammohan,"For the first use case (Recommendation system)

Assuming we have the details about user age, user salary, user family details, history of insurance purchase, history of renewing policies.

1. as told by you, we can use age as a factor to recommend.
2. if the user as parents who are very old, we can recommend any old-age policies we have.
3. we can recommend policies based on customer's health history.
4. based on the number of years customer is linked with us, he/she is likely to stay with us because of all the trust we have earned.
5. customer who has to support a big family but earns less"
875,Muneeb Anwar,For the second problem the actual problem here is to minimize inventory costs because if you overestimate the materials needed you need extra space and the money used on the extra inventory could have been better used elsewhere this is pretty much a demand forecasting problem from operations research I think there are alot of models for this already I remember reading about it in a book
876,Shravan Anantharamakrishnan,"For the 3rd facial products use case
The face_recognition library in python enables us to extract 128d encoding of the faces based on triplet loss function
So this can be used to extract a 128d vector and since the predicted value in this case should belong to multiple classes, I will use a one layer neural network with sigmoid activation function as softmax can be used only if the predicted value belongs to only one class
False negatives will be like classifying bearded person as a non bearded person and recommending  beard oil 
False positives will be like classifying non beared person as a bearded person and  recommending trimmers"
877,sourav agarwal,"For the very first use case on recommendation system. Since a rule based system was already in place, it is safe to assume that we have a dataset comprising of user records and the various policies purchased by them. Further down, if we consider that we log in the click-through rate of the recommendations as well the other policies checked in by users, collaborative recommender system could be built. Additionally, for users who already have a history of purchases, a combination of collaborative and content-based recommendation would be very useful. On the evaluation front, instead of measuring the accuracy of the recommendation, top-k accuracy would be a more suitable choice. 

Some scenarios could fall into place: The company would miss out on recommending certain policies due to a lower rank score on the recommendation system (probably, historically customers did not purchase certain policy types). Instead of merely recommending the policies based on applicability, certain attribute based recommendation such as how convenient would a certain policy be for an individual as compared to the previous policies, should be combined along with other policies. 

Most important thing about policies, is to maximize the revenue on the part of the insurance company as well as providing convenience and hassle free-service to the policy holders."
878,Piyush Singh,For 2nd use case it is : Multivariate timeseries forecasting having past covariates and future covariates. We can check Darts library for this.
879,Rushikesh More,"for the second use case provide solution through building forecasting model  which will predict  required mangos, so here i will consider following attributes 
1. mango history ( Traget variable )
2. I will consider season variable/month/ as dummy variable so I can get impact of season as fruity has more sale in summer
3.rainfall in the season
4.i will also add number of natural calamities(like any disease/flood/cyclones)

I will use Mape error for evaluation ( to forecast higher than actual because mape is assymetric )
Challanges
1. i feel challenge is getting reliable information about attribute 3 & 4 and its actual numbers
2. inventry of raw material would be depend upon future sales of fruities so future sales data we can use ( may be we need to build model forecast that too ) where we can use var model 

I tried to answer please correct me if i am wrong sir."
880,Sinha,"1. Recommendation System:
When a person log in, get all the information regarding the person like what product he/she likes, what does the person prefer, get the browsing history of that person. Now based on the product he/she buys, we can set item-based filtering recommendation or collaborative -based filtering. Now, to tackle the cold start problem, whenever a new person comes in for the first time, show what products does he/she likes, show the tags. Once we have the data we get specific based on tag and at least show some recommendation.

2. Facial Recognition:
First we have to determine what are all the range pf products available i.e.what products are available for what part of the face. We have to check if the person is male or female. Train a model or use a pretrained model which will get the facial characteristics of the face, like if it detects a beard then recommend beard oil or a trimmer. For the female recommend cream, lotion based on the marks, spots on the face. This can be done with uploaded photos or real time camera using openCV. Similarly, like the previous to tackle cold start problem, show what products he/she is interested in, show the tags, get the history etc.

3. Logistic Procurement:
The main objective here I believe is to show whether or not we need more material or less material for the product. This is a kind of optimization problem where we are minimizing the raw materials needed. I have 2 approach for this-
  a. First one is model based. First, we have to see what different types of juice are there to make. Based on that we have to see the material we need to build the product. We have get all the characteristics/features of the juice which contributes in using raw materials more or less. We can build a model based on those and either predict whether it will use more or less material (binary classification task) or predict what is amount of material the product is going to use (linear regression task). 
  b. The second way is based on heuristic approach. If the product use different material to to be build i.e. let say some amount of each 'n' material to make a product. Now to minimize the amount needed for each material we can use genetic algorithm to get that or other optimization algorithm to do that.Though this not so efficient, if we have lets say 100 products each using 'n' materials type as we have to do for all.

4. Car Problem:
This use case is in kinda broad spectrum. I am no knowledge in car making but still answering it.
  a. Damage Detection: A car has many parts inside and outside the body. We can separate damage detection in terms of ""analog i.e. mechanical parts and digital i.e. in software parts"".
      i. For the damage detection in mechanical parts like brakes, engine, tires etc. we can build a model which can detect damage and do segmentation of that part. For this to happen we need to install camera inside the engine hood and underneath the car. A damage can be detected not only by images but with sensors too. The car software can analyze the data to get a warning like this parts seems fishy, kindly check it out.
     ii. For the damage in the software parts, show warning about the software parts.
To make it work both side needs to work together.

  b. AC control: First off sense the outside temperature via sensor, sense the inside of the car also, get the temperature from both sides, then don't turn on the AC immediately just show a prompt on the screen whether or not turn on the AC. Let's keep the action on the user part. Imagine if someone has cold inside the car and suddenly it turn on the AC, good luck. Or imagine the person doesn't want the AC, he/she can pull down the windows."
881,MANOJ KUMAR,Really nice explanation regarding use cases... I expect some real world use cases related to projects... I hope you will upload soon thank you sir 
882,atheeq shaik,For first use case By Using Content Based Filtering in recommended systems we can recommend anything
883,Aditya Naranje,For 1st use case we may use collaborative filtering
884,Karthik Bhandary,"The usecase with raw products: My idea is that if we collect the data which basically impacts the production of the raw materials, We can feed it the our model to predict the amount of raw materials getting produced with give or take 5-7% error only. (We obviouly will provide the target variable as well. Also, if this is a wrong way please just tell me because I am a beginner in this!)"
885,Ojas Kulkarni,"1st use case: Recommendation system for insurance company
Sol: 
User features that can be considered => age, salary, marital status, family size, dependent parents, current/past illnesses, place of residence, demographics of the area (like population, literacy, etc) which can be found through reliable online resources. 
Based on user features & features of the insurance plan we can use a content based filtering recommendation system.
 
2nd use case: Forecast pre-pocessed food product raw material pocurement
(like Frooti or any juice)
Sol:
Features: 
type of raw material, 
availability/price of raw material across the year, 
cost involved in storing the raw material in inventory
demand over the pas years.
 
Challenges: 
inavailability of raw material due to rainfall or any other natural causes
transportation problems like material handling.
sudden fall in demand due to factors like defamation, competition, etc.
 
Model:
Use linear regression to forecast demand from past year data. 
with predictor being year, population of the area and response being the predicted demand (no of products). 
requirement for all the raw materials = (qty of raw material req/product) x (demand)
The procured mangoes may also have some defective pieces so we need to consider 1-2% margin over that.
Can perform RFM analysis to Recency, Frequency and Monetary to identify key demographics
 
3rd use case: Recommend cosmetic products based on facial features
Sol:
We can either
Use DeepFace model to extract facial features and use those features to recommend the cosmetic using decision tree classifier or content based filtering recommendation system
or
Directly feed the model with Face data use it to predict the product from available products by treating it as a classification problem.
 
Possible Challenges:
Bad images, 
falsely identified marks on face,
sometimes the gender may also be incorrectly identified
 
4th use case: Maintenance alarm and AC temp adjusting model
Sol:
Take input from sensors in the car located in various components.
Use time-series analysis to determine failure/maintenance criteria set by the standards.
Combine all the data and using models based on RNN/LSTM predict the maintenance due date from current date.
Convert the time into distance-based average daily kms and inform the owner 5000 kms prior to maintenance due kms.
 
We'll need to consider parameters like comfort, battery or fuel usage, slope which the car is climbing, current speed of the car
to adjust AC temp. Like when climbing a slope we must turn off the AC or when the temp outside is very high we can go to lower temp but that would also depend on fuel availability.
Considering all such factors we can first try to find if the problem can be solved using linear/polynomial regression or we would need an ANN(which would also involve additional hardware in the car). So that choice again depends on car-to-car."
886,Mohit Dubey,"for  Second use case 
 our objective is to recommend products to specify person that can buy or willing to buy . there  can more than 3 ways 
way to solve 1.. step1.use person camera  and  to get facial features of person 
    step 2 use ml model to predict  products   prioritise  
step 3 show top 3-5 priority products 
way to solve 2..
          using big data and social media data of our customers 
         train ANN  or RNN  and pron of this approach is the this way become better and better as increasing number of customers data"
887,Mallika Mehta,for second project we can either use openCV   or cascade classifier  and  product recomender  by tensorflow or forcasting as well .......
888,Avinash Vaskar,"For the second usecase, we will go for forecasting"
889,piyush,"For the 1st case
We use gender and age parameter and apply knn or svm"
890,mahesh kanase,"First usecase...

Insurance recommendation system.
Basic details we get is age,sex,demography etc etc..
First we consider it is as cold start problem and we can recommend product which are similar to age interval and demographic feature etc.

After that we can track user serach and using that searches we can recommend user by using user user similarity or item item similarity.
