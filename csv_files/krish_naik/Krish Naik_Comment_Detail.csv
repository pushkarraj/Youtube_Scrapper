0,Deepak Holla,"Hi Krish, Your Statistics related videos are a real boon for anyone breaking into the Data field. Kudos to all your efforts!!!"
1,Anurag,"Few use cases of statistics in predictive modeling:
1. Validating distribution of target variable 
2. Before building models we do have a few hypothesis in our mind or business. After getting the data and target finalization we have to test our hypothesis using various tests.
3. Hypothesis testing used in feature selection as well. Like if a variable adding significant value to a model predictions
4. After models building statistics used in modeling monitoring such as significant reduction in model performance accuracy or KS or hit rate etc"

3,Imtiyaz Shaikh,"More power to Krish bhai

4,venki vtz,"To find how your model perform, most of the times we use different measurements like f1-score etc... are also statistical measurements only. A small question to all, why we have to divide with n-1 for Variance or SD for sample , but when we calculate for population Var or SD, we divide with n ( n is the no of subjects in the sample or sample size) . Dont escape with avoid Bias. let us make it more statistical"

22,Siva Kumar,"Price=[7,3,5,6,20,1,2] .  Could you please write logic with this list .
Here max profit is 17"
23,Akshay Kumar Singh,"In first question- 
For finding min price why we are using loop, we can just do list.min() take the value and store in a variable. And then with that reference find max benefit, that's it. 

No? 
Am I wrong, please correct me anyone."
24,Gurpreet Kaur,Veryy nicely explained
25,Rishi Raj,Great thanks
26,RAGHU RAM,"Hi Sir.. my request, please make industry specific projects like 5 projects all from banking domain,5 projects from retail,5 projects from Healthcare etc.. that will help candidates from functional background  who are speacialised in single domain.. generalist can opt for this existing course & specialist can choose their domain.."
27,Bibek Rauth,"It's great. But the only concern is when you say the industry-ready project, it's not the same.  Because free data doesn't represent the actual raw data. Many times when we work on a project it takes months to understand and gather the data. And working on 5 or 6 different domain projects, would not give a business understanding of any of the domains. Rather working on a particular domain's 5 6 projects would build the understanding."
28,Tanish,"Nice one, this is what i was looking for and got it. but few suggestions from thecomments box like DL, NLP nd domain wise projrct can be looked into if possible...thank you so much sir. you are doing an amazing socialwork (vidhya seva, which greater thanall) by your DS videos and guidelines. thank you again and wish you all success in your life."
29,Syed Saqlain Ahmed,"Sir, please replace two projects with deep learning projects for CV and NLP ."

33,Rahul,"Sir, its a humble request, please provide this live course on tech neuron       "
34,Karan saini,Sir are these projects will be integrated with FSDS-NOV batch? Or is it different batch?
35,Saptarshi Sanyal,"Hi Krish, I am confused. I am a student of FSDS, will there be any extra stuff in this industry ready project course?"
36,Gustavo Navarro Lema,"Excellent content of the bootcamp...I have a question: after completing the program, can I apply for jobs outside of Argentina? And is there the self-paced option due to time differences (ARG-INDIA)?"
37,Ratul Sur,Do we get all recoreded videos of the live classes...in case if we miss any class that would help a lot
38,Mehul Rampratap Nayak,Is therse course available for tech neuron subscribers as you said in your earlier videos that all courses other than job guarantee would be available for tech neuron subscribers.
39,TARINIPRASAD DAS,Sir I have enrolled for FSDS 2.0 . SHOULD I also purchase this course?
40,Sanjay,What is the prerequisite for this course? Whether I need to complete data science fullstack course?
41,Tushar Dhuri,"Krish You should either provide a list to start (roadmap kind of ) for enrolling courses in tech neuron .So a student should not be confused to where to start .
Just a suggestion like the career or skill track for the domain like datacamp or 365 data science.
Also , the ineuron upcoming section is kinda flawed .Unable to see new courses in next 60 days.Just a random video come up from respective teacher and can see the course after that .

341,venkat anil Adibhatla,"Hey Krish I think something is wrong with your screen,I can see only half of your screen.i am not sure ,if everyone has this issue.please confirm it."
342,Abhishek Chatterjee,"In case of Kmeans it uses distance from centroid as a measure of similarity and due to this metrics it can compute distance of a unknown data point to the closest centroid and assign a label to it.

For hierarchical clustering algos, the problem statement is to figure out all possible sets of cluster which it does in a interative manner either starting from top / bottom and dividing / fusing data points using affinity and linkage method. So for a new data point it can not predict which cluster as it does not have a measure to do so other than recomputing entire clustering which is again the fit method.

Same goes for spatial ones as they measure similarity / disimilarity using density estimation so it can not predict a label for a single data point hence no predict method."
343,Souvik Adhikary,"In my opinion The way of computing clusters makes all the difference:
1. Firstly in K-means, a data-point is assigned to the cluster with the closest centroid and then the centroids are updated afterwards. So, predicting in the K-means is actually assigning the datapoints without updating the clusters, given that the prediction data are from the same distribution of data as the training set.
2. DBSCAN on the other hand finds the cluster based on the high-density areas of the dataset. These densities are parametrized by parameters epsilon and min-points. This is done by computing point properties i.e whether the point is a core, border and noise or outlier. Now during predicting if the new points are close to, say a noise and core point, the point could mess up the previous clustering results and make the noise point a border or within epsilon. This could also be the case with (min-points-1) new points added within the epsilon of noise, which again will recompute the cluster.
3. Same as DBSCAN, Agglomerative (bottom-up approach) clustering iteratively builds the cluster starting from single data points and successively agglomerates pairs of cluster until all the clusters are merged into a single cluster according to a linkage measure. Let the linkage measure be ""single"", which merges the clusters if all the points between two cluster are less than a threshold. Now adding a new point during prediction could trigger a merge between two clusters that would have been separated otherwise. Thus predicting here also requires recomputing."
344,Zevier Sunil Seema,"I think it is because When you use k-means clustering you define the k i.e. the number of centroids i.e. also the number of clusters you want your k-means model to divide your dataset into. 
So the number of clusters the k-means model divides the X_train dataset into is equal to the number of clusters the k-means model divides the X_test dataset into as the number of clusters/centroids (k) is given by us to the model.
This is the reason why we are able to predict when using k-means clustering.
Now when it comes to dbscan or agglomerative clustering
It is the model/algorithm that gives us the numbers of clusters it has 
divided our dataset into.
So the number of clusters the model divides the X_train dataset into may or may not be equal to the number of clusters the model divides the X_test 
dataset into as both of these dataset i.e. X_train and X_test are two different datasets.
And this is the reason why we are not able to predict when using dbscan and agglomerative clustering.
So to conclude, the reason that we are able to predict in k-means clustering is that the number of clusters formed in the train dataset is equal to the number of clusters formed in the test dataset when used k-means clustering 
And the reason we are not able to predict in dbscan and agglomerative clustering is that the number of clusters formed in the train dataset may or may not be equal to the number of clusters formed in the test dataset when used dbscan or agglomerative clustering."
345,Ayan Chowdhury,"In my opinion, 
Kmeans clustering uses number of clusters on the k value. It is just formation of non overlapping clusters which are similar to one another. Hence test data can be predicted. 
But for agronomic clustering, it divides the data into bottom up or top down way. That is single cluster is created and natural hierarchy is formed as set of tree. On predicting test data the labels on which the tree or hierarchy can be formed in unknown. 
Similar thing goes in DBScan clustering, it creates clusters on the theme of reachability and connectivity which is a density function. Here epsilon is very important in finding the clusters. If we take the same labels for predicting test data it may include all noises and would be highly ineffective."
346,Ayush Anchal,"In k-means, new data point is assigned to the closest centroid 
But in hierarchical clustering, it builds clusters iteratively starting from single data point,  if a new data point comes it will recompute the clusters an hence can entirely modify the final cluster."
347,"ùëπ, ùíã","Sir, which will be better to me in terms of Salary and opportunities? Software developer v/s Data Scientist?
I am third year Engineering student from tier-3 college..."
348,Nadmaan Fazeel,"DBSCAN doesn't initialize centers because there is no centers in DBSCAN ( it works on connectivity of points). 
Kmeans family perform classification( like KNN algorithm) using the previous cluster center and then update the centers. 

Solution to this problem :- 
In R, there is a predict function under DBSCAN class , first it will cluster the data then we have the dataset of data points vs label , here it becomes a classification problem when new points come we will assign a label based on our classification model. 

Drawbacks of kmeans 
1. Can't deal with periodic data ( angle, hours etc) 
2.prone to outlier 
3. Require prior cluster information 
4. Performed badly on high dimensional data 
5. Clusters are always in spherical form and not of arbitrary shape."
349,Harsh Maheshwari,for agglomerative it must be recomputational approach as top to down  which consume lots of work for algorithm.........

351,Harsh Maheshwari,in case of dbscan....it do it with density approach and single data point cannot be the estimator of density ...that's why prediction is not the case
