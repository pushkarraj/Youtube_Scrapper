I request everyone to please share this who are still not getting or waiting for right programming resources."

I'm Virendra Shukla, 
I've enrolled in A Job Ready Bootcamp in C++, DSA,and IoT. 
This is my first online live course. How can I say that your recorded classes are so good but paid online live classes are better then in which we can intract to teachers to solve our doubts. Really, sir I've seen almost your recorded YouTube videos which are very useful to me but some points of them were become myths to me. But sir, when i started to take classes of ""Bootcamp"" its really starts to break my myths.
Thanku so much Sir. You're great and you're my best guider in my teachers. Again thanku so much Sir to providing such type of courses and efforts in such prices."
947,LearnWithPrince,"Sir jab maine aapki class join nhi Kiya tha to mujhe coding ke baare mai pta hi nhi tha.

953,Abhinav Kumar,"Hello Sir ,  I am beginner in learning C language and your way of teaching is excellent . Had I learned from teachers like you in my college days I would never feared learning programming languages. 
I am able to solve more than 95% of question in assignment given by you. However sometime when after solving question I see for solution   , logic which you uses is superior than my logic which I have used to solve the question .  I think your next lectures in which you discuss just the problem will be extremely helpful for developing those logic. Looking forward for next live problem solving sessions."
954,Kaushal Kumar,The c programming which you taught in so easy way that absolutely beginner which is not  much interested in programming can take it as interesting subject I am very thankful to saurav shukla sir and his team for delivering such best content in c whatever you taught make difficult and complex thing more simpler and also interesting with the help of example I followed you sir for last one year

957,Abhishek Pathak,"Thank  you sir for live classes in youtube again also i learn lot of tings form you also you  tell new thing in class,nice to hear your motivation     and i relly  enjoyed your teaching style you are best teacher in the world.... "
958,Torche,"When I first started learning Programming Language I struggled a lot..my professors used to simply copy the code and ask us to write the code and follow along without explaining the background and fundamentals and essential of Computer Programming...But Saurabh Sir made things simpler and started from very basics. I attended his C language community classes and got a broader perspective towards programming for the change. His ability to explain comes with great clarity about that subject. I thoroughly understood the concepts like Binary Language, need to code, purpose of code,. I have already joined his Bootcamp to learn more and get knowledge which he has from years. 
Saurabh sir sets a clear path:
1. Programming is fun but it needs time and patience
2. Programming is about trying and exercise your brain cells instead of giving up and searching for the solution  
3. Learning C/C++ enables you to learn other languages much more efficiently 
These were the things I learnt from sir. So guys share his content as much as possible as he knows how to teach..unlike other individuals who just know how to code"
959,Khushi Kala,Thank You So Much Sir for community classes. Teachers like you are boon for the students like us.
960,Riya Garg,"Sir, you are the best . It's only because of you that I am able to start m career in this field.. Thanks alot for your soo much efforts. Your way of teaching is amazing.

Hope you are doing good!
 I am really very very inspired a lot. you know sir, I am frustrated after the launch of 1st-year classes in the online mode of my college because nothing is understood in class or it's my first time when I interact with the word programming. on and when one of my friends told me to watch your videos on , I really like programming. Your teaching style is really unique from others. From that day I enroll myself in every course of MySirG which is for me like c language and then data structure and now I brought c++ from I neuron. I really appreciate your mehnat which you do for average students at an effective price. Thanks and regards‚Ä¶. Love you sir."
